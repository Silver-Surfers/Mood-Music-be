// Upgrading via Dashboard //

To upgrade via the Heroku Dashboard, navigate to your app settings page and click the Upgrade Stack button. Confirm that you want to upgrade, which will set the stack to the latest version.

The Upgrade Stack button is only shown if you have sufficient permissions to update the stack on the app.

For apps that have previously been built, you will see that the stack upgrade is pending; the upgrade will take effect on the next deploy. For apps where code has never been deployed (such as add-on only apps), the stack change will take immediate effect and so for them a new deploy is not required.
